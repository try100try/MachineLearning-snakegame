# MachineLearning-snakegame
This is a simple test to check if my 40 iq is worthy of machine learning programs.
The overall test of this is to see if i can make a simple snake game and then add a neural network to this game to check if it's able to learn the rules and adapt.

Todo:
1. Make the game (done).
2. Find a neural network library (done).
3. make the game accessible with it (done i think).
4. add the neural network to the system, and fix them bugs that'll 100% show up (not yet).
5. Get a minimum wage job and start cucking (boutta get done)
